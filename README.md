## Project Overview 
In this project, I aim to analyse a sales dataset to uncover valuable insights that can guide decision-making for potential investors. The dataset includes various sales metrics and historical data points  containing Order data from 2009-2012 related to different sales opportunities.

# Project Objective
-	Which product category had the highest sales?
-	What are the Top 3 and Bottom 3 Regions with regard to sales?
-	What were the total sales of appliances in Ontario?
-	KMS incurred the most shipping cost using which shipping method?
-	Who are the most valuable customers, and what do they purchase?
-	Which small business customer had the highest sales?
-	Which Corporate Customer placed the most number of orders in 2009 – 2012? How many orders were placed by the corporate customer?
-	Which consumer customer was the most profitable one?
-	Which customer returned items and what segment do they belong

##Recommendations for Kultra Mega Store (KMS)
1. Increasing Revenue from Bottom 10 Customers
.   To increase revenue from the bottom 10 customers, KMS could implement the following strategies:
   
-   Personalised Marketing Campaigns: Target these customers with personalised offers or loyalty programs. Use purchase history to suggest likely products that can complement the ones they have bought in the past from the store.
  
-   Bundling and Discount Offers: Offer special discounts for future purchases. For example, if these customers frequently purchase office supplies, offer a discount on a bundle that includes technology products or furniture.
  
-   Follow-up Engagement: Encourage a feedback mechanism from these customers to understand why their spending is low. Follow-up communication through emails or calls can help retain their loyalty and identify potential up-sell or cross-sell opportunities.

2. Evaluation of Shipping Costs Based on Order Priority
   
-   Based on the dashboard information, it appears that the Delivery Truck is used more frequently, which implies it is likely the default choice. Given that it's the most economical but slowest option, this may be appropriate for lower-priority orders. However, if KMS wants to optimise shipping costs based on Order Priority, here’s what could be improved.
  
-Appropriate Use of Express Air for High-Priority Orders: If Express Air is the fastest but most costly method, it should only be used for orders termed as high priority, where speed is crucial for customer satisfaction.

-Delivery Truck for Low-Priority Orders: This method is suitable for orders where delivery speed is not a primary concern. It saves costs but may impact customer satisfaction if used inappropriately for higher-priority orders.

##Conclusion
-   KMS could benefit from a structured shipping policy that selects the shipping mode based on each order's priority. Proper alignment of shipping costs with order priorities can lead to better cost management and enhance customer satisfaction without unnecessary expense.
